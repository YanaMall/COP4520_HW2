//Problem 1
For this problem, I decided to hard code that number of guests at 50. This code essentially observes whether a 
plate at the end of the maze has a cupcake on it, to determine whether or not a new guest had entered the maze and eaten it. 
I believe this program will correctly as I have based the logic off of what what discussed in class and tried to implement in code. 
I couldnt find a way to preform this with threads.

//Problem 2
For this problem, I based the code off of what I used for problem 1, because they practically have the same problem, 
that being the need to track new entries amongst a queue with repeated entries. I believe this solution is correct because
it correctly displays when a new person has entered and when someone has already entered.
I couldnt find a way to solve this with threads.
